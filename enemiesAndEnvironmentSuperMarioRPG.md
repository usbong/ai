# AI notes: Enemies and Environment

Rewards and Punishment

Based on actions of player given the scenario, meaning you have to do things a certain way; otherwise, heavy damage, or dead right away; more noticeable than in other games;

## Areas for Improvement

Damage auto-adjusts arbitrarily; 

At times, it's difficult to understand if the monster increased its defense against physical attacks and is now vulnerable to magic attacks;

Other times, one-hit dead misses even without the accessory to be immune to such types of attack;

Or monster performs multiple attacks causing immediate death to companion with full health;

Or heroes' increased damage using timed button presses no longer work; the same goes with the use of healing magic
